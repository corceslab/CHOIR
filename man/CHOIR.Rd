permutation test comparisons of cluster distinguishability. Defaults to 0.05.}

adjustment to use. Permitted values are 'fdr', 'bonferroni', and 'none'.
Defaults to 'bonferroni'.}

\item{feature_set}{A string indicating whether to train random forest
classifiers on 'all' features or only variable ('var') features. Defaults to 'var'.}

\item{exclude_features}{A character vector indicating features that should be
excluded from input to the random forest classifier. Default = \code{NULL}
will not exclude any features.}

\item{n_iterations}{A numeric value indicating the number of iterations run
for each permutation test comparison. Defaults to 100.}

\item{n_trees}{A numeric value indicating the number of trees in each random
forest. Defaults to 50.}

\item{use_variance}{A boolean value indicating whether to use the variance of
the random forest accuracy scores as part of the permutation test threshold.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{min_accuracy}{A numeric value indicating the minimum accuracy required
of the random forest classifier, below which clusters will be automatically
merged. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{min_connections}{A numeric value indicating the minimum number of
nearest neighbors between two clusters for them to be considered 'adjacent'.
Non-adjacent clusters will not be merged. Defaults to 1.}

\item{max_repeat_errors}{Used to account for situations in which random
forest classifier errors are concentrated among a few cells that are
repeatedly misassigned. Numeric value indicating the maximum number of such
'repeat errors' that will be taken into account. If set to 0, 'repeat errors'
will not be evaluated. Defaults to 20.}

\item{distance_approx}{A boolean value indicating whether or not to use
approximate distance calculations. Default = TRUE will use centroid-based
distances.}

\item{distance_awareness}{To omit all distance calculations, set to
\code{FALSE}. Otherwise, a numeric value representing the distance threshold
above which a cluster will not merge with another cluster. Specifically,
this value is a multiplier applied to the distance between a cluster and its
closest distinguishable neighbor, giving the threshold. Default = 2 sets
this threshold at a 2-fold increase in distance.}

\item{collect_all_metrics}{A boolean value indicating whether to collect and save
additional metrics from the random forest classifiers, including feature
importances and tree depth. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{sample_max}{A numeric value indicating the maximum number of cells used
per cluster to train/test each random forest classifier. Default = \code{Inf}
does not cap the number of cells used.}

\item{downsampling_rate}{A numeric value indicating the proportion of cells used
per cluster to train/test each random forest classifier. Default = "auto" sets
the downsampling rate according to the dataset size, for efficiency.}

\item{min_reads}{A numeric value used to filter out features prior to input
to the random forest classifier. Default = \code{NULL} will filter out
features with 0 counts for the current clusters being compared. Numeric input
values should be used only with count input matrices, e.g., ATAC tile
matrices, whereby at least 1 read will be required for the provided number
of cells.}

\item{max_clusters}{Indicates the extent to which the hierarchical clustering
tree will be expanded. Default = 'auto' will expand the tree until cases of
underclustering have been eliminated in all branches. Alternately, supply a
numerical value indicating the maximum number of clusters to expand the tree
to.}

\item{min_cluster_depth}{A numeric value indicating the maximum cluster size
at the bottom of the clustering tree, prior to pruning branches. Defaults to
2000.}

\item{normalization_method}{A character string or vector indicating which
normalization method to use. In general, input data should be supplied to
CHOIR after normalization, except in cases when the user wishes to use
\code{Seurat::SCTransform()} normalization. Permitted values are 'none' or
'SCTransform'. Defaults to 'none'.}

\item{subtree_reductions}{Whether to generate a new dimensionality
reduction for each subtree. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{reduction_method}{A character string or vector indicating which
dimensionality reduction method to use. Permitted values are 'PCA' for
principal component analysis, 'LSI' for latent semantic indexing, and
'IterativeLSI' for iterative latent semantic indexing. Default = \code{NULL}
will specify a method based on the input data type.}

\item{reduction_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed to
the selected dimensionality reduction method.}

\item{n_var_features}{A numerical value indicating how many variable
features to identify. Default = \code{NULL} will use 2000 features, or 25000
features for ATAC-seq data.}

\item{batch_correction_method}{A character string or vector indicating which
batch correction method to use. Permitted values are 'Harmony' and
'none'. Defaults to 'none'.}

\item{batch_correction_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed
to the selected batch correction method for each iteration. Only applicable
when 'batch_correction_method' = 'Harmony'.}

\item{batch_labels}{If applying batch correction, the name of the column
containing the batch labels. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{neighbor_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed to
\code{Seurat::FindNeighbors()} (or, in the case of multi-modal data for
Seurat or SingleCellExperiment objects,
\code{Seurat::FindMultiModalNeighbors()}).}

\item{cluster_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed to
Seurat::FindClusters() for clustering at each level of the tree. Note that if
'group.singletons' is set to TRUE, buildTree relabels clusters such that each
singleton constitutes its own cluster.}

\item{use_assay}{For Seurat or SingleCellExperiment objects, a character
string or vector indicating the assay(s) to use in the provided object.
Default = \code{NULL} will choose the current active assay for Seurat objects
and the \code{log_counts} assay for SingleCellExperiment objects.}

\item{use_slot}{For Seurat objects, a character string or vector indicating
the slot(s) to use in the provided object. Default = \code{NULL} will choose
a slot based on the selected assay. If a non-standard assay is provided, do
not leave \code{use_slot} as \code{NULL}.}

\item{ArchR_matrix}{For ArchR objects, a character string or vector
indicating which matri(ces) to use in the provided object. Default =
\code{NULL} will use the 'TileMatrix' for ATAC-seq data or the
'GeneExpressionMatrix' for RNA-seq data.}

\item{reduction}{An optional matrix of dimensionality reduction cell
embeddings to be used for subsequent clustering steps. Defaults to
\code{NULL}, whereby dimensionality reduction(s) will be calculated using
method specified by 'reduction_method' as part of the \code{buildTree()}

\description{
This function constructs a hierarchical clustering tree starting from a single
cluster encompassing all cells. First, a root tree is constructed, from which
subtrees are subsequently generated. Each branch is subdivided until all
cases of underclustering are eliminated. Then, CHOIR will move iteratively
up the provided hierarchical clustering tree, and use permutation tests of
random forest classifier prediction accuracies to identify which clusters
should be merged, in order to identify robust final clusters.

\details{
For multi-modal data, optionally supply parameter inputs as vectors/lists
that sequentially specify the value for each modality.
