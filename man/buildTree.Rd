classifiers on 'all' features or only variable ('var') features. Defaults to
'var'.}

\item{exclude_features}{A character vector indicating features that should be
excluded from input to the random forest classifier. Default = \code{NULL}
will not exclude any features.}

\item{n_iterations}{A numeric value indicating the number of iterations run
for each permutation test comparison. Defaults to 100.}

\item{n_trees}{A numeric value indicating the number of trees in each random
forest. Defaults to 50.}

the random forest accuracy scores as part of the permutation test threshold.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

of the random forest classifier, below which clusters will be automatically
merged. Defaults to 0.5 (chance).}

\item{min_connections}{A numeric value indicating the minimum number of
nearest neighbors between two clusters for them to be considered 'adjacent'.
Non-adjacent clusters will not be merged. Defaults to 1.}

\item{max_repeat_errors}{Used to account for situations in which random
forest classifier errors are concentrated among a few cells that are
repeatedly misassigned. A numeric value indicating the maximum number of such
'repeat errors' that will be taken into account. If set to 0, 'repeat errors'
will not be evaluated. Defaults to 20.}

\item{distance_approx}{A boolean value indicating whether or not to use
approximate distance calculations. Default = \code{TRUE} will use
centroid-based distances.}

\item{sample_max}{A numeric value indicating the maximum number of cells used
per cluster to train/test each random forest classifier. Default = \code{Inf}
does not cap the number of cells used.}

\item{downsampling_rate}{A numeric value indicating the proportion of cells
used per cluster to train/test each random forest classifier. Default =
"auto" sets the downsampling rate according to the dataset size, for
efficiency.}

\item{max_clusters}{Indicates the extent to which the hierarchical clustering
tree will be expanded. Default = 'auto' will expand the tree until instances
of underclustering have been eliminated in all branches. Alternately, supply
a numeric value indicating the maximum number of clusters to expand the
tree to.}

\item{min_cluster_depth}{A numeric value indicating the maximum cluster size
at the bottom of the clustering tree, prior to pruning branches. Defaults to
2000.}

\item{normalization_method}{A character string or vector indicating which
normalization method to use. In general, input data should be supplied to
CHOIR after normalization, except in cases when the user wishes to use
\code{Seurat::SCTransform()} normalization. Permitted values are 'none' or
'SCTransform'. Defaults to 'none'.}

\item{subtree_reductions}{A boolean value indicating whether to generate a
new dimensionality reduction for each subtree. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{reduction_method}{A character string or vector indicating which
dimensionality reduction method to use. Permitted values are 'PCA' for
principal component analysis, 'LSI' for latent semantic indexing, and
'IterativeLSI' for iterative latent semantic indexing. Default = \code{NULL}
will specify a method automatically based on the input data type.}

\item{reduction_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed to
the selected dimensionality reduction method.}

\item{n_var_features}{A numeric value indicating how many variable features
to identify. Default = \code{NULL} will use 2000 features, or 25000 features
for ATAC-seq data.}

\item{batch_correction_method}{A character string or vector indicating which
batch correction method to use. Permitted values are 'Harmony' and
'none'. Defaults to 'none'.}

\item{batch_correction_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed
to the selected batch correction method for each iteration. Only applicable
when \code{batch_correction_method = 'Harmony'}.}

\item{batch_labels}{If applying batch correction, a character string or
vector indicating the name of the column containing the batch labels.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{neighbor_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed to
\code{Seurat::FindNeighbors()} (or, in the case of multi-modal data for
Seurat or SingleCellExperiment objects,
\code{Seurat::FindMultiModalNeighbors()}).}

\item{cluster_params}{A list of additional parameters to be passed to
Seurat::FindClusters() for clustering at each level of the tree. Note that if
\code{group.singletons} is set to \code{TRUE}, \code{CHOIR} relabels initial
clusters such that each singleton constitutes its own cluster.}

\item{use_assay}{For Seurat or SingleCellExperiment objects, a character
string or vector indicating the assay(s) to use in the provided object.
Default = \code{NULL} will choose the current active assay for Seurat objects
and the \code{logcounts} assay for SingleCellExperiment objects.}

\item{use_slot}{For Seurat objects, a character string or vector indicating
the layers(s) — previously known as slot(s) — to use in the provided object.
Default = \code{NULL} will choose a layer/slot based on the selected assay.
If a non-standard assay is provided, do not leave \code{use_slot} as
\code{NULL}.}

\item{ArchR_matrix}{For ArchR objects, a character string or vector
indicating which matri(ces) to use in the provided object. Default =
\code{NULL} will use the 'TileMatrix' for ATAC-seq data or the
'GeneExpressionMatrix' for RNA-seq data.}

\item{ArchR_depthcol}{For ArchR objects, a character string or vector
indicating which column to use for correlation with sequencing depth.
Default = \code{NULL} will use the 'nFrags' column for ATAC-seq data or the
'Gex_nUMI' for RNA-seq data.}

\item{countsplit}{A boolean value indicating whether or not to use
countsplit input data (see A. Neufeld \code{countsplit} package), such that
one matrix of counts is used for clustering tree generation, and a separate
matrix is used for all random forest classifier permutation testing. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{countsplit_suffix}{A character vector indicating the suffixes
that distinguish the two countsplit matrices to be used. Suffixes are
appended onto input string/vector for \code{use_slot} for Seurat objects,
\code{use_assay} for SingleCellExperiment objects, or \code{ArchR_matrix} for
ArchR objects. When countsplitting is enabled, default = \code{NULL} uses
suffixes "_1" and "_2" such as result from default application of CHOIR
function \code{runCountSplit()}.}

\item{reduction}{An optional matrix of dimensionality reduction cell
embeddings to be used for subsequent clustering steps. Defaults to
\code{NULL}, whereby dimensionality reduction(s) will instead be calculated
using method specified by \code{reduction_method}.}

\item{var_features}{An optional character vector of variable features to be
used for subsequent clustering steps. Defaults to \code{NULL}, whereby new
sets of variable features will instead be generated.}

\item{atac}{A boolean value or vector indicating whether the provided data is
ATAC-seq data. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. For multi-omic datasets containing
ATAC-seq data, it is important to supply this parameter as a vector
corresponding to each modality in order.}

\item{n_cores}{A numeric value indicating the number of cores to use for
parallelization. Default = \code{NULL} will use the number of available cores
minus 2.}

\item{random_seed}{A numeric value indicating the random seed to be used.}

\description{
This function performs the first step of the CHOIR algorithm. It constructs
a hierarchical clustering tree starting from a single cluster encompassing
all cells. First, a parent tree is constructed, from which subtrees are
subsequently generated. Each branch is subdivided until all cells are
demonstrably overclustered.
}
\details{
For multi-modal data, optionally supply parameter inputs as vectors/lists
that sequentially specify the value for each modality.
